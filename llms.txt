# Listo Labs — Shopify Development & Engineering Partner

> Small by design. Big enough to ship what matters.

## About
Listo Labs is a boutique Shopify development team of two senior engineers. We specialize in production-grade Shopify engineering — not template installs and plugin stacking. Founded in 2018, we've shipped 50+ stores and currently maintain 6 active retainer clients.

We embed directly in client teams via Slack, Asana, or Linear. No account managers. No ticket queues. You work directly with the people writing your code.

## Services

### Custom Theme Architecture
Full custom Shopify theme builds using Online Store 2.0 standards. Sections everywhere, app blocks, dynamic sources, and metafield-driven content. Optimized for performance, accessibility, and merchant usability.

### Online Store 2.0 Migrations
Migration from legacy Shopify themes to modern OS 2.0 architecture. We preserve existing customizations while unlocking sections everywhere, JSON templates, and the theme editor.

### Storefront Performance Optimization
Core Web Vitals optimization including Liquid render performance, critical CSS, asset lazy loading, image optimization, and third-party script management. We've taken stores from PageSpeed scores in the 40s to 90+.

### Checkout Extensions & Shopify Functions
Custom checkout UI extensions for Shopify Plus. Payment and delivery customizations. Shopify Functions for discount logic, validation, cart transforms, and fulfillment constraints.

### Metafield & Metaobject Schema Design
Structured content architecture using Shopify's metafield and metaobject systems. Custom product specs, size guides, FAQ content, store locators, and cross-referenced data models.

### Liquid Engineering & Code Review
Deep Liquid expertise for complex template logic, dynamic rendering, performance-critical sections, and theme architecture. Code review and refactoring for maintainability.

### B2B Wholesale (Shopify Plus)
Complete B2B wholesale setup including custom pricing tiers, net payment terms, company accounts, catalogs, and quantity rules.

### ERP & Custom System Integrations
Custom integrations connecting Shopify with ERP systems (NetSuite, SAP), inventory management platforms, order management systems, fulfillment providers, and third-party APIs. We build reliable data flows using Shopify APIs, webhooks, and Shopify Flow.

### AI-Powered Search & Personalization
Integration of AI-powered product search, intelligent recommendations, automated merchandising, and personalization engines (Algolia, Klevu, Rebuy, custom solutions). We help stores leverage machine learning to increase conversion rates and AOV.

### Headless Commerce
Hydrogen and Remix-based headless storefronts using the Storefront API. Custom frontends with Shopify as the commerce backend.

## Pricing
Development retainers start at $8,000/month. Minimum engagement: 6 months. This covers dedicated access to two senior Shopify engineers embedded in your workflow.

## Clients
Feetures, Free Fly Apparel, ChappyWrap, LegacyBox, Allegiance Flag Supply, Victory Brewing Company, WizardPins, Chosen Foods, and 50+ other Shopify stores across DTC, food & beverage, apparel, and specialty retail.

## How We Work
1. A quick call — or just an email — to understand your store, your stack, and what's holding you back.
2. We embed in your workflow, ship to preview themes, and iterate fast. You'll see real code in days, not weeks.
3. Every deploy goes through preview review. Nothing touches your live store without your sign-off.
